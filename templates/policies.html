    <h2 id="1">1. General guild policies</h2>

    <p>Midnight Order is primarily a guild that aims to be friendly, easy-going and helpful towards its
        members. We engage in both end-game PvP and PvE content, so players interested in either or both
        aspects of this game are welcome. Since we primarily deal with such content, we generally don’t
        accept low level characters, unless they are alts or friends known to other guild members; in
        any case, each application from a low level character (alt, friend or totally new guild member)
        is considered on an individual basis. Even though we may accept a few low level characters, it
        is important to stress that bugging other people for help in a persistently rude manner is
        frequently frowned upon and should be avoided. Other than that, our guild welcomes both casual
        and hardcore gamers; in fact, one of the first goals considered, when the first incarnation of
        our guild was created (back then when we were the Wind Of Death on Sporeggar), was to create a
        group of people that could help players who don’t have the luxury to play many hours per day and
        thus miss content that requires others’ contribution.</p>

    <p>One of the lessons learnt from our experience with our previous guild is that having relaxed
        rules on inactivity results in a guild looking more and more like a dumping ground for unwanted
        or forgotten characters. For this reason, we have a rule on activity, which is simple yet
        strict: a guild member who is inactive for a month or more gets kicked out of the guild, unless
        he or she notifies one of the Officers by in-game mail of his or her absence (and, preferably,
        of its duration). In that case, the Officers will make a relevant note on the guild member’s
        Officer Note. For obvious reasons, if a guild member has one or more alts in the guild, this
        rule does not apply if any of his or her characters (main or alts) are active. Also, if a guild
        member has the Veteran rank, this rule will not be strictly enforced, due to the requirements
        for obtaining that rank.</p>

    <p>Additionally, a guild member will get kicked out if he or she is a trouble-maker. Trouble-making
        can be done in two fronts: inside and outside the guild. Inside the guild (public guild channels
        and Mumble), please be considerate of other people’s feelings and do not make any comments that
        may be inappropriate or offensive. If you have any comments to make about other members’
        behaviour, keep it in private channels; our Officers are always willing to listen to complaints
        and concerns from our members and will do their best to solve any issues. We would like to keep
        this guild drama-free. Even if you talk to a fellow guild member privately, be mindful not to
        insult them; we reserve the right to kick members out of the guild if their behaviour is deemed
        unacceptable towards others. Especially regarding raid issues (raiders’ performance, loot, spots
        and rotation, time and date of raids) and PvP performance, the only permissible way to raise an
        issue is through whispers to Officers, raid leaders or PvP leaders or an in-game mail. Even
        outside the guild, however, we strongly believe that our members can build up our reputation on
        the server, so members whose behaviour and statements on public channels reflect poorly on our
        guild may well be kicked out of it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, if a guild member has continuously shown that the only reason he or she stays in the
        guild is in order to earn money, either by getting items from the vault with the sole purpose of
        reselling them, withdrawing money from it when not needed for his or her level, or simply
        bothering other members all the time so that they lend him or her money for no reason other than
        him or her simply being lazy, it is also possible that such a member will eventually get kicked
        out from the guild. The guild does not demand money or specific items from its members; its
        members should have the same attitude towards their fellow guild members.</p>

    <p>All of our guild members are required to register on our web site. If a guild member has not done
        so, he or she will also get kicked out of the guild. Obviously, if a guild member has alts in
        the guild, only one registration is required. Other than registration, active participation in
        our forums is not required, although strongly recommended. In any case, our raiders and PvP
        players, engaged in rated battlegrounds, will need to visit our forums on a regular basis and
        will find that they are the most convenient way to express their possible concerns and/or wishes
        concerning them.</p>

    <p>The Officers of the guild are always willing to help, but they are not the only ones. We are
        particularly proud of the great atmosphere we have in our guild chat and of the generous help
        many of our members lend to each other, so don’t hesitate to ask for it when in need.</p>

    <p>As mentioned before, the activities of Midnight Order include, among other things, engaging in
        end-game PvP and PvE content. Additionally, since Defias Brotherhood is an RPPvP server, any
        players who want to organise RP (role-playing) happenings are free to do so. Note, however, that
        we do not require of our members to act in character while in guild chat or when playing
        together, since our main philosophy is to be a guild that accommodates any play style, be it
        casual or hardcore, deep in role-playing or focusing on PvE or PvP only.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="2">2. Guild Positions</h2>

    <p>Our guild needs dedicated guild members who will help in the administration of specific aspects
        of the guild. With the exception of the position of “Vault Master”, which, due to its nature,
        can only be accepted by Officers, the other positions can be held by guild members of any rank.
        Nevertheless, when a guild member assumes a guild position and therefore becomes a leader, he or
        she gains the Leader rank, so that the duties that position entails can be fulfilled more
        easily.</p>

    <p>At the moment, we have the following positions:</p>
    <h4>1. Vault Master</h4>

    <p>Vault Master, currently held by Sedi (and his alt Alvaren) and Emmique, responsible for clearing
        up the vault and giving items from it to other guild members who have reached the daily limit
        and urgently need a particular item from it; trading items between the guild vault and our guild
        members, between the guild vault and the AH (neutral and Alliance) and between Alliance and
        Horde, with the sole purpose of gaining profit for the guild vault; and assigning gathering and
        crafting tasks to guild members. Note that these positions are explained in more detail in our
        Guild Vault Policies section of our website. Furthermore, our raid and PvP leaders (with the
        Officer rank) also have advanced access to it and generally are responsible for specific tabs
        within the vault dedicated to raiding and end-game PvP content. We currently need one more Vault
        Master.</p>
    <h4>2. Webmaster</h4>

    <p>Webmaster, currently held by Borizian, responsible for the day-to-day running of our guild web
        site; any questions or requests regarding it should be addressed to our Webmaster. Please, use
        the “Paypal” button found on our website to donate real money to our site; unfortunately, this
        site is not free! The cost of it and the money gathered so far, as well as further details, can
        all be found in the appropriate section of our site. We currently need one more Webmaster.</p>
    <h4>3. Forum Moderator</h4>

    <p>Forum Moderator, currently not held by anyone, responsible, quite surprisingly, for moderating
        our forums. We currently need two Forum Moderators.</p>
    <h4>4. Facebook Moderator</h4>

    <p>Facebook Moderator, currently held provisionally by Ceradien (and her alt Eagyn) and Sedi (and
        his alt Alvaren), responsible for maintaining our Facebook page. We currently need one Facebook
        Moderator.</p>
    <h4>5. Raid Leader</h4>

    <p>Raid Leader, currently held by Galvino (and his alt Galariomaxos), Shadybrit and Tolinka,
        responsible for organising raids and heroic and challenge runs, maintaining our Mumble servers
        and setting up the rules for our raids, as explained in another part of our guild policies. The
        Raid Leaders are also responsible for our "Raiders’ retreat" section of our forums, which, among
        other things, is the one our members must use if they want to ask for a particular raid that is
        not on normal raiding schedule at any given period. Finally, as mentioned elsewhere, the Raid
        Leaders must organise the raids for each raiding week on the Sunday preceding it; that also
        includes sending all the invitations through the in-game calendar. We currently need no more
        Raid Leaders.</p>
    <h4>6. Recruitment Officer</h4>

    <p>Recruitment Officer, currently held by Ceradien (and her alt Eagyn) and Smáckdown, responsible
        for the recruitment of newcomers, especially those who wish to participate in our end-game raids
        and rated battlegrounds, which includes, among other things, replying to every single
        application thread on our site, updating our recruitment thread on the official Defias
        Brotherhood forum with information on what classes we are currently most interested in, always
        in coordination with our raid leaders and PvP leaders, and passing on all the relevant details
        to our Webmasters, so that they update our web site accordingly. The Recruitment Officers may
        not necessarily hold the Officer rank. We currently need one more Recruitment Officer.</p>
    <h4>7. Class Leader</h4>

    <p>Class Leader, whose duties consist of giving advice when needed to members who ask for it,
        posting important information on our subforums dedicated to specific classes and informing the
        raid leaders and PvP leaders on the suitability of guild members of the class our Class Leaders
        are responsible for to participate in specific raids or rated battlegrounds. The Class Leaders
        are expected to spend some time in-game with such members in order to show them how they can
        improve their performance and, most importantly, actually test them in a way deemed most
        adequate, in order to determine such members’ skills and understanding of their class. There may
        be more than one Class Leader for specific classes, especially if those classes are hybrid ones.
        We currently need Class Leaders for all classes and specs.</p>
    <h4>8. Role Leader</h4>

    <p>Role Leader, whose duties are similar to those of the Class Leaders, but specialized in specific
        roles inside raids (tanks, healers and DPS) or rated battlegrounds (heavy DPS, crowd
        controllers, flag carriers and healers), rather than classes. These duties include providing
        information on those roles regarding tactics as well as gear in general. We currently need Role
        Leaders for all PvE and PvP roles.</p>
    <h4>9. PvP Leader</h4>

    <p>PvP Leader, responsible mainly for organising premades for battlegrounds (BGs) and rated
        battlegrounds (RBGs), but also offering assistance to those of our members willing to explore
        that aspect of the game, especially by using the guild vault's resources, in close cooperation
        with our Vault Masters. Like Raid Leaders, PvP Leaders must send all the invitations through the
        in-game calendar for each raiding week on the Sunday preceding it; even though a raiding week
        has not much importance for rated battlegrounds, guild members who are active in the PvP aspect
        of the game should know well in advance the schedule and plan </p>
    <h4>10. RP Leader</h4>

    <p>RP Leader, currently not held by anyone, responsible for organising roleplaying (RP) events
        whenever the Guild Master, the Officers or the leaders need one, as well as staging more
        involved and complicated RP sessions, through the use of dedicated RP addons. We currently need
        two RP Leaders.</p>

    <p>As is expected from our Officer and Guild Master, all leaders must show the same amount of
        patience with the guild members and their behaviour must be impeccable when dealing both with
        guild members and non-guild members. A proven level of maturity and leadership skills are
        required for a guild member to assume one of these positions. Any abuse of power will result in
        the guild member losing that position. As it is clear, becoming a leader entails a lot of work;
        consequently, we try to enforce a rule of one position per guild member only. Needless to say,
        it is up to the Guild Master and the Officers to decide on assigning such a task to a guild
        member; all applications are always considered, but there is no guarantee that they are
        accepted.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="3">3. Guild Ranks</h2>

    <p>Midnight Order has 9 ranks. The three highest ranks are “Guild Master”, “Officer” and “Leader”.
        Zoordavros is our Guild Master. We currently have five Officers: Borizian, Alvaren (and his alt
        Sedi), Galvino (and his alt Galariomaxos), Ceradien (and her alts Eagyn and Mezzidrel), Emmique
        and Shadybrit (and his alts Bekíe and Tethís). The ranks of “Officer” and “Leader” are not
        normal ranks that our members will one day reach; Officers have specific duties for the general
        functioning of the guild and are chosen by the Guild Master. The main duty of our Guild Master
        and our Officers is to grant promotions to our members, but if you have any problem or question
        regarding our guild, please refer it to them and they will be glad to help you. Similarly,
        Leaders have specific duties for specific activities of the guild.</p>

    <p>The rest of the ranks can be potentially acquired by all guild members. The first three ranks are
        granted according to the level a guild member’s character has.</p>

    <p>The next two ranks (“Raider” and “Vanquisher”) are granted to level 90 members only, whom our
        raid leaders or PvP leaders have accepted in their PvE or PvP raiding team, the difference
        between them being that the highest rank of the two (“Vanquisher”) requires the ability, gear-
        and knowledge-wise, to enter the latest raids in the game (in case of PvE players), as well as a
        recommendation from the raid and PvP leaders (for both PvE and PvP players). That recommendation
        will be a result of exceptional skills, as demonstrated in raids and rated BGs, and will be at
        our leaders’ discretion. Finally, the “Vanquisher” rank is also available to our RP players who
        have shown remarkable imagination and witty roleplaying skills during our RP events, as
        determined by our RP leaders.</p>

    <p>The sixth rank (“Veteran”) is only granted to level 90 members (unless that member was a Veteran
        before the latest expansion), but it has some additional requirements: such member must be
        trustworthy and a long-time resident of our guild. The “Veteran” rank has extra privileges in
        end-game content and is truly a rank our members are expected to earn through their personal
        behaviour inside the guild. Note that it is possible to be granted this rank without being an
        active raider or PvP or RP player, even though a Veteran has more privileges to the guild vault
        than previous ranks; a Veteran can actually be a casual player or simply someone who merely
        wants to hang around with us.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the first rank, “Initiate”, although it is a rank that level 1-20 guild members
        have, is also the testing phase of newcomers to the guild; no matter the level a newcomer has,
        he or she stays in the “Initiate” rank for exactly two weeks. After that period, that member
        will be promoted to his or her suitable rank, unless the character is still in the 1-20 bracket,
        in which case he stays in the “Initiate” rank. For this reason, every time a new member is added
        to the guild, it is our Officers’ and Leaders’ duty to write an Officer note on his profile,
        stating the date he joined, so that it is clearly known in advance when the testing period ends.
        This rule does not apply to alternative characters (“alts”) of current guild members who have
        been in the guild for more than two weeks. The reasoning behind this feature is twofold: on the
        guild’s behalf, it is there in order to prevent newcomers, especially of higher levels, to join
        the guild with the sole purpose of getting expensive items out of the guild vault and then leave
        the guild after a few days; on the members’ behalf, the two weeks are a period in which they can
        evaluate the guild and decide whether they want to stay or leave, if this guild is not what they
        expect.</p>

    <p>With that being said, the following table contains all the ranks and the prerequisites for
        acquiring them:</p>

    <h2 id="4">4. Guild Vault Policies</h2>

    <p>The guild vault is but a tool to further the aims of our guild, as explained in our General guild policies,
        namely to
        help lower level members advance their characters and their profession skills, as well as to aid higher level
        characters in their group and raid efforts, both in PvE and in PvP content. Ideally, items will be deposited by
        those who don’t need them and used by those who do. That means that you should never take items out of the guild
        vault for resale, but only for personal use. Acceptable use also includes, apart from wearing and using items
        appropriate to a member’s level, using materials to raise one’s profession skills or in order to create items
        that
        will benefit a guild member himself or the rest of the members. As with other items, materials should never be
        taken
        out of the vault for the sole purpose of selling them at the Auction House. Since end-game materials can be
        quite
        expensive and in order to make sure that they are indeed taken out of the vault for their intended use, only the
        highest-ranked guild members can withdraw items from the guild vault tab containing them, after a request by a
        guild
        member concerned.</p>

    <p>A successful guild vault, in our view, is one in which there is a constant flow of items being placed in and
        withdrawn from; a vault that remains static, with items left in it for a very long period of time, means that it
        is
        full of items useless to the guild members. In order to keep the vault useful, the Vault Masters will remove
        such
        items, sell them to vendors and deposit the amount of money earned back to the guild. Nevertheless, it is
        advised
        that our guild members do not burden the already heavy schedule of our Vault Masters and try to avoid placing
        items
        in the vault that we have decided not to keep in there, in accordance with the detailed rules that follow.</p>

    <p><u><b>In general, the first four tabs are devoted to leveling, mostly leveling professions, while the other three
        tabs are devoted to end-game content.</b></u> Keep in mind, however, that in each tab there is a specific place
        for
        each
        category of items, as explained in the following rules. Again, please try to keep each tab organised and
        carefully
        read these
        instructions before placing an item in the vault. For ease of use, the content of each tab can also be found in
        the
        “Info” section of it.</p>

    <p>As a result of the method chosen for the first four tabs, which are devoted to leveling, they can be fully
        accessed
        by guild members of all levels. Guild members of lower level can still deposit items in the rest of the tabs,
        but
        they cannot take items from them.</p>

    <p>Guild members can take a certain number of items per day and can use guild repairs up to a specific amount per
        day.
        Veterans and Officers can also withdraw specific amounts of money per day. This changes according to rank and
        can be
        easily found out by simply checking the guild vault with your character in-game, as well as in the rules you’ re
        reading. Please note that not all ranks have the ability to withdraw money.</p>

    <p>Remember, try to place items to their corresponding tabs, as specified in detail in these rules.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, grey items are strictly forbidden from being placed in the vault, with the exception of any RP
        items
        that the RP Organiser should decide to place in the vault, in agreement with the Vault Masters</p>

    <p>There are several useful addons that facilitate searching for items in the vault and finding a specific item in
        it;
        “GuildBankSearch” and “BankItems” are just two of them and are listed here as a suggestion only.</p>

    <p>Again, use your own judgment when placing items in the vault. It takes some attention from all of us to maintain
        our
        tabs as much organised as possible.</p>

    <p>Parts of the guidelines given below are also posted at the “Info” part of each tab of the guild vault in the
        game.
        These parts are in bold letters in this site.</p>

    <p>The following should not be placed in the vault: containers with fewer than 14 slots and gear that can be used by
        characters of level less than 20.</p>

    <p><b>Each column consists of two sub columns, for a total of 14 item slots.</b></p>

    <p><b>
        <h4>Tab 1 (Recipes):</h4>

        <div>Column 1: Recipes for cooking and first aid, regardless of level; also, bags (14 or more slots).</div>
        <div>Column 2: Recipes for alchemy and engineering.</div>
        <div>Column 3: Recipes for inscription and blacksmithing.</div>
        <div>Column 4: Recipes for leatherworking and tailoring.</div>
        <div>Column 5: Recipes for enchanting</div>
        <div>Column 6: Recipes for jewelcrafting.</div>
        <div>Column 7: Reagents, oils and pearls.</div>
    </b></p>

    <p><b>
        <h4>Tab 2 (Gathering):</h4>

        <div>Unless otherwise stated, any item requiring the highest currently available profession level in order to be
            used or crafted should not be placed in this tab.
        </div>
        <div>Column 1: Metals and stones.</div>
        <div>Columns 2 and 3: Herbs.</div>
        <div>Column 4: Skins.</div>
        <div>Columns 5 and 6: Minerals.</div>
        <div>Column 7: Materials and food ingredients.</div>
    </b></p>

    <p>As a general rule, if there is not enough space for specific items, Vault Masters have to prioritise and either
        sell
        those items in excess or use them to craft other items.</p>

    <p>In order to help our Vault Masters to handle our Guild Vault, as well as for the benefit of our guild members, it
        is
        useful to explain the categories of items as used by the game:
    <ul>
        <li>Augment: a special enchant-granting item that does not require the services of an enchanter in order to be
            applied, but is crafted with other professions or obtained from quests or vendors. This is a permanent
            enchant,
            unlike other buff-granting items, like oils and imbues. S. also enchantment.
        </li>
        <li>Bag: a container that a character can equip and use to hold other items.</li>
        <li>Bandage: an item crafted with First Aid that can be applied to the using player or a friendly target (player
            or
            pet) that restores health over a period of time.
        </li>
        <li>Bar: an item crafted from raw ores (a type of metals) and maybe other ingredients with mining or other
            professions (like Enchanted Thorium Bar with enchanting and Arcanite Bar and Truegold with alchemy).
        </li>
        <li>Bolt: a roll of cloth processed by a tailor and used as an ingredient. All such items have the word “bolt”
            in
            their name.
        </li>
        <li>Cauldron: an item created by alchemists that, when used, creates an item on the ground that can be clicked
            by
            other players in order to get potions or flasks (for example, Cauldron of Major Arcane Protection).
        </li>
        <li>Cloth: an ingredient item that either drops from humanoids or demons, or can be crafted by tailors. All such
            items have the word “cloth” in their name or as part of a composite word in their name (for example,
            Mooncloth),
            but if their name includes the word “bolt”, then they are considered bolts. Cloths include items crafted by
            tailors that fulfill the following conditions: they require bolts in order to be crafted; they have neither
            the
            word “cloth” nor the word “bolt” in their name or as part of a composite word in their name; and their only
            use
            is as an ingredient for tailoring (for example, Ebonweave and Moonshroud).
        </li>
        <li>Consumable food: a type of food that can be eaten by both players and hunters’ pets.</li>
        <li>Crafted item: any item that can be crafted with a profession (even if it can be obtained through other
            means,
            like Snowball) and does not fall under any other category.
        </li>
        <li>Crystal: s. Magical element.</li>
        <li>Crystallized ingredient: s. Elemental ingredient. This category includes Crystallized Fire, Air, Earth,
            Water,
            Life and Shadow. They were introduced with Wrath of the Lich King.
        </li>
        <li>Currency: any item accumulated and used to make purchases (for example, Mark of the Illidari, Glowcap and
            Sunmote).
        </li>
        <li>Darkmoon card: an item that forms part of a deck that, when used in combination with all the other items
            from
            that deck, creates a Darkmoon deck.
        </li>
        <li>Darkmoon deck: an item created with Darkmoon cards that can be turned in to the Darkmoon Faire in exchange
            of an
            item and Darkmoon Faire reputation.
        </li>
        <li>Drink: a beverage item that can be consumed and can do any of the following: restore mana (for example,
            Refreshing Spring Water), provide a benefit other than mana restoration (for example, Egg Nog and Captain
            Rumsey's Lager) or cause the character to become tipsy (for example, Junglevine Wine). A beverage item that
            does
            any of the above but also has other side-effects (for example, Lifegiving Seed) is still considered a drink.
        </li>
        <li>Dungeon and raid crafting material: item used in epic level recipes (but also in non-epic ones) and either
            dropped from mobs and bosses in dungeons and raids or sold from vendors in exchange of Justice Points or
            Honor
            Points (like Primal Nether, Nether Vortex, Heart of Darkness, Frozen Orb, Runed Orb, Crusader Orb, Living
            Ember,
            Fiery Core and Lava Core). For the purposes of the Guild Vault, if such items can fall under another
            category
            (for example, Sunmote and Primordial Saronite, which are also currency items), they are not considered
            dungeon
            and raid crafting materials. S. also reagents.
        </li>
        <li>Dust: s. Magical element.</li>
        <li>Elemental essence: s. Elemental ingredient. This category includes: Essence of Fire, Air, Water and Earth;
            Living Essence; and Essence of Undeath.

            Water,
            Heart of the Wild and Ichor of Undeath; elemental essences; elemental motes and primal ingredients;
            crystallized
            ingredients and eternal ingredients; and volatile ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Elemental mote: s. Elemental ingredient. This category includes Motes of Fire, Air, Earth, Water, Life,
            Shadow
            and Mana. They were introduced with The Burning Crusade.
        </li>
        <li>Elixir: a consumable item that a character can drink, which will apply a buff or an effect to that player
            for a
            long duration (1 hour or more).
        </li>
        <li>Enchantment: a special enchant-granting item that requires the services of an enchanter in order to be
            applied.
            This is a permanent enchant, unlike other buff-granting items, like oils. S. also augment and imbue.
        </li>
        <li>Epic and rare world drop: an item of epic or rare quality that has a random chance to drop off any mob or
            chest
            (within a certain level range) anywhere in the world; if such items can be found in another way, they are
            not
            considered epic and rare world drops. For the purposes of the Guild Vault, an item is an epic and rare world
            drop only if it is a piece of armour or a weapon.
        </li>
        <li>Essence: s. Magical element.</li>
        <li>Eternal ingredient: s. Elemental ingredient. These ingredients can be formed by combining their respective
            crystallized ingredients. They were introduced with Wrath of the Lich King.
        </li>
        <li>Feast: type of food crafted with cooking that, when used, creates an item on the ground that can be clicked
            by
            other players in order to get a buff usually acquired through consumable food (for example, Gigantic Feast).
        </li>
        <li>Flask: a consumable item similar to elixirs, but whose effects persist through death.</li>
        <li>Food ingredient: a type of food that can be eaten by hunters’ pets, but not by players, and used as an
            ingredient for cooking consumable food, as well as an item that can only be used for cooking recipes but
            cannot
            be eaten by neither hunters’ pets nor players (for example, Northern Spices and Giant Egg). If a type of
            food
            can be used as an ingredient for cooking recipes but at the same time can be eaten, it is considered
            consumable
            food.
        </li>
        <li>Food: an item that can be any of the following: an item that can be eaten by players or hunters’ pets; an
            item
            that can be used as food ingredient but cannot be eaten by neither hunters’ pets nor players; or a feast.
            Edible
            food (that is not a feast) can be any of the following seven categories: meat, fungus, fish, bread, cheese,
            egg
            and fruit, all of which can be eaten by hunters’ pets, with the exception of eggs. Food can either be
            consumable
            food or a food ingredient.
        </li>
        <li>Gem: this is an item that can be placed in the socket of another item to give that item additional bonuses.
            They
            include the so-called “cut or epic gems” of higher level.
        </li>
        <li>Glyph: spell and ability enhancement crafted by scribes.</li>
        <li>Herb: a plant ingredient primarily gathered with herbalism from plants, but also found as a drop from mobs
            or in
            containers, and is used for crafting items by other professions.
        </li>
        <li>Hide: s. skin. All such items have the word “hide” in their name; an item with such a word in its name which
            is
            not used as an ingredient for any profession is not considered a hide.
        </li>
        <li>Imbue: a consumable item that temporarily enhances another item. For the purposes of the Guild Vault, an
            item is
            considered an imbue only if it does not fall under another category (like Superior Mana Oil, which is an
            oil).
            Such items can either be applied to a piece of armour (like Lesser Rune of Warding and Greater Ward of
            Shielding), to a weapon (like Deadly Poison, Iron Counterweight, Sharpening Stone and Weightstone) or to a
            fishing pole (like Flesh Eating Worm, Shiny Bauble and Feathered Lure).
        </li>
        <li>Keystone: item found when digging for archaeology artifact fragments and designated as such in its
            tooltip.
        </li>
        <li>Leather: s. skin. All such items have the word “leather” in their title; an item with such a word in its
            name
            which is not used as an ingredient for any profession is not considered to be leather.
        </li>

            category
            includes essences, dusts, shards and crystals.
        </li>
        <li>Material: any item that can only be used for crafting items (without any other use) and does not fall under
            any
            other category (for example, Soul Essence).
        </li>
        <li>Metal: an item that falls under any of the following categories: raw ore mined from veins and deposits
            (previously called “nodes”); an item that is named “ingot” in-game and is used both as a quest item and an

            found
            either in containers throughout the world or dropped from mobs, and is used in the completion of quests. An
            item
            that is named “ingot” in-game but serves no purpose other than as a quest item (for example, Lighforge
            Ingot) is
            not considered a metal for the purposes of the Guild Vault.
        </li>
        <li>Mineral: these are precious stone items that can be acquired either through mining or through prospecting,
            thus
            falling in the categories of both gathered and crafted items. Minerals are also called “raw gems”. Minerals
            of
            higher level include the so-called “uncut gems”. Minerals were called “gems” before The Burning Crusade.
        </li>
        <li>Oil: a category of items crafted by alchemists and enchanters. They can be used as an ingredient by
            alchemists
            (for example, Fire Oil); as a consumable and, more specifically, a potion (for example, Lesser Mana Oil,
            Minor
            Wizard Oil and Brilliant Mana Oil); or as a temporary buff-granting item (for example, Frost Oil). This
            category
            does not include oils that are dropped in the world and are used as reagents.
        </li>
        <li>Pearl: a precious gem-like item that can be found in clams; brought from vendors in exchange of clams;
            dropped
            from mobs linked in one way or another to the sea; or sometimes contained in containers found around the
            world
            (like or chests) or given as a reward for fishing dailies. They are often used as ingredients in
            professions.
            All of them have the word “pearl” in their title, with the exception of Siren’s Tears.
        </li>
        <li>Potion: a consumable item that a character can drink and which will apply a buff or an effect to that player
            instantly or for a small duration (less than 5 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>Primal ingredient: s. Elemental ingredient. These ingredients can be formed by combining their respective
            elemental motes. They were introduced with The Burning Crusade. They also include Primal Might, which has no
            equivalent elemental mote.
        </li>
        <li>Quest item: item whose only use is to be turned in using a quest mechanic (for example, Relic of Ulduar, Fel
            Armament, Mark of Kil'jaeden, Mark of Sargeras and Oshu'gun Crystal Fragment).
        </li>
        <li>Reagent: a broad category of items that includes items that fall under other categories of items, but which
            are
            designated as reagents in-game (at the Auction House). For the purposes of the Guild Vault, an item is a
            reagent
            only if it does not fall under another category. For the purposes of the Guild Vault, this group of items
            includes the following: an item required to cast a specific spell or use a specific ability, only if it is
            not
            sold by a vendor (for example, Light Feather); and an item that is dropped from mobs and is used in order to
            craft an item with a profession (for example, Larval Acid), unless it is dropped from mobs in dungeons and
            raids
            only, in which case it is classified as a dungeon and raid crafting material.
        </li>
        <li>Recipe: a generic term to describe either an item that improves the skill of a player’s profession or an
            item
            that teaches a player to craft a new item in his profession. They can appear in the form or under the name
            of
            the following: books, designs, formulas, manuals, notes, paper sheets, parchments, patterns, plans, recipes,
            schematics, scrolls, techniques or volumes.
        </li>
        <li>Scale: s. skin. All such items have the word “scale” in their name or as part of a composite word in their
            name
            (for example, Worn Dragonscale); an item with such a word in its name which is not used as an ingredient for
            any
            profession is not considered a scale.
        </li>
        <li>Scroll: an item that can be read in order to be used, consuming it and granting either the character using
            it or

        </li>
        <li>Shard: s. Magical element.</li>
        <li>Silk: an item dropped from spiders and used as an ingredient in various professions. All such items have the
            word “silk” in their name (for example, Shadow Silk).
        </li>
        <li>Skin: an item that can be found when skinning a mob and used as an ingredient by various professions. This
            category includes leathers, scales and hides, as well as items that have the word “carapace” (for example,
            Heavy
            Silithid Carapace), “chitin” (for example, Silithid Chitin) or “fur” (for example, Arctic Fur) in their
            name.
        </li>
        <li>Stone: an item designated as “stone” in-game, gathered from mineral veins and deposits and used as an
            ingredient
            for various professions. Contrary to metals (and, more specifically, raw ores), stones cannot be smelted
            into
            bars.
        </li>
        <li>Volatile ingredient: s. Elemental ingredient. This category includes Volatile Fire, Air, Earth, Water and
            Life.
            They were introduced with Cataclysm.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Important note: for your information, Wowpedia (primarily) and, to a lesser extent, Wowhead and the in-game
        categorisation in the Auction House have been used in order to create these categories.</p>

    <p>In order to help everyone concerning the level of each item, the following table on profession skill levels will

    <p>Our Vault Masters are also responsible for assigning gathering responsibilities to our guild members. This is
        done on
        a voluntarily basis; if you are willing to help the guild collect more money, please let our Vault Masters know
        about it and they will set up certain goals for you to accomplish. Such goals will almost always be the donation
        of
        mats and crafted items to the vault, so that the guild can use them afterwards as it sees fit. When such goals
        are
        met, you will be given the “Contributor” privileges for a week; during that time, you will be able to buy items
        from
        the vault (usually through our Vault Masters) for 40% of their market value in the Auction House, as determined
        by
        the necessary addons our Vault Masters use. Normal guild members (those who are not Contributors) buy such items
        at
        70% discount price, while Initiates at 85%. The Vault Masters will make a relevant note on the Contributors’
        Officer
        notes, mentioning when the privileged week’s time ends; for each additional contribution of such a guild member
        (as
        determined by the new goal set again by the Vault Master), an additional week’s time will be added to the
        Contributor’s Officer note. Such notes will have the following form: “C.-d.m.y” (where “d”, “m” and “y” stand,
        surprisingly enough, for day, month and year respectively). Please note that no abuse of this system will be
        allowed; make sure you notify the Vault Masters of your willingness to contribute first, let them set up a goal
        for
        you and then donate the stacks of items they request. Simply donating items to the vault without having agreed
        with
        the Vault Masters on what’s needed will not make you a Contributor and they will merely be regarded as donations
        (which are always welcome, of course).</p>

    <p>To summarise, there are three possible ways for a guild member to withdraw items from the vault:
    <ul>
        <li>Withdraw up to his or her daily limit; general rules apply for this method (no reselling please) and abuse
            will
            have consequences.
        </li>
        <li>Trade any items he or she has with items already deposited in the vault. In order to do that, the guild
            member
            needs to contact a Vault Master and arrange the transaction with them.
        </li>
        <li>Buy items from the vault. Depending on the guild member’s status (Initial, regular Member, Contributor),
            there
            is a discount on such items based on current market price at the Auction House (85%, 70% and 40%
            respectively).
            To that end, Vault Masters are requested to create a sticky thread at the “Guild Vault” forum of our web
            site,
            which will be regularly updated and will list the prices (at the three possible discounts) for most
            important
            and frequently needed items, as they deem important. Such items may include end-game consumables (flasks,
            potions and elixirs), gems and enchants, as well as mats, but it is up the Vault Masters’ discretion to
            include
            a specific item in such a list. If an item a guild member wants can be found in the Discount List, he or she
            need not wait for a Vault Master to be online and make a transaction with him; the guild member may simply
            take
            the item from the relevant tab (provided he has access to it and has not exceeded his or her daily limit, of
            course) and donate the amount required to the bank. In all other cases, an agreement with a Vault Master
            needs
            to be made before such an item is withdrawn.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Please note the important differences between methods 1 and 3 above: while method 1 is allowed only for items
        that a
        guild member needs (either to use on a character or to raise a profession skill), method 3 can also be used for
        profit, such as buying mats from the guild vault in order to craft an item that will be sold later on.</p>

    <p>Guild members can also sell items to the vault, instead of donating them, at 50% of their Auction House price. In
        order to prevent abuse of the system by Contributors, who buy items at 40% of the Auction House price, any
        amount of
        these items cannot be bought back from the vault by Contributors at 40% discount, but rather at 50%, until one
        week
        passes from such sale. It is forbidden to take items from the vault (using method 1 above) that one has
        previously
        sold to; this restriction applies for 3 weeks from such sale. Please note that it is up to the Vault Masters to
        accept each individual sale, based on the needs of and the money available in the vault. The vault is never
        obliged
        to buy items from guild members.</p>

    <p>In order to encourage donations (money or items) and, to a lesser extent, sales to the vault, every month our
        Vault
        Masters will organise a donation lottery. Each player who donates money or items to the vault can remind our
        Vault
        Masters of it with an in-game mail and be issued lottery tickets; the same applies to guild members who sell
        items.
        Depending on the importance of each donation, each time the guild member will earn a different amount of
        lotteries;
        the exact number of lottery tickets is decided by our Vault Masters, who are also requested to create a sticky
        thread at the “Guild Vault” forum of our web site, which will list an approximate number of lottery tickets each
        trunk of a certain amount of gold donated the guild member concerned is entitled to. That list will also contain
        how
        much lottery tickets a guild member who donates items to the vault is entitled to, depending on the importance
        of
        those items; however, since it is impossible to list all potential items that can be donated to the vault, only
        the
        most significant items (and the number of lottery tickets they represent) will be listed. As a rule of thumb,
        each
        meaningful sale will entitle a guild member to one lottery ticket, while each meaningful donation will entitle a
        guild member to at least five lottery tickets. At a specific date each month, determined by our Vault Masters,
        an RP
        event shall take place in order to determine the lottery winner. Such an event shall be organized by our RP
        leaders
        or, if they are not available (or we are short of them) the Vault Masters themselves. The winner will go away
        with
        3000 gold from the vault. Please note that, in order to be given lottery tickets, you must ask for it from the
        Vault
        Masters, who will then check your donations. The amount of lottery tickets each potential winner has gathered
        shall
        be listed in the “Guild Vault” forum of our web site, together with the numbers a guild member’s lottery tickets
        have. At the event itself, a number will be chosen from among those available and that will determine the
        winner. If
        a participant in this lottery cannot make it at the time the event is going to take place, he has to inform the
        Vault Masters, but his tickets will still be eligible to win.</p>

    <p>Apart from the lottery event, our Vault Masters (again, with the assistance of our RP leaders, if they are
        available)
        shall organise a general lottery every 3 months. In this lottery, only those guild members who are present at
        the
        event can participate. Moreover, contrary to what applies to the donation lottery, each participant is issued
        only
        one numbered lot and therefore no list has to be created on our forums. Guild members of the Initiate rank
        cannot
        participate in this lottery. The prize is 5000 gold.</p>

    <p><u><b>Please note that both lotteries depend on the amount of gold available in the vault. If the Vault Masters
        believe that the amount of gold we have in our vault cannot support these events, they will not happen.</b></u>
    </p>

    <p>Finally, it needs to be stressed that any abuse of our vault rules may result in warnings and eventual kicking
        out of
        the guild. In any case, our Vault Masters have the final say in any issues that arise concerning the use of our
        vault.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="5">5. Raid Rules</h2>

    <p>Raiding is admittedly the most difficult and stressful aspect of the game to be organised. It
        requires dedication, willingness to learn and listen to advice, reliability and availability,
        raid awareness and focus and, above all, perfect knowledge of your class’s strengths and
        weaknesses. Even though we have people willing to offer advice, it needs to be stressed that our
        Class Leaders’ role is primarily to alleviate the burden from our raid leader in determining who
        is eligible for our raids and who isn’t ready yet. It is our members’ personal responsibility to
        know everything about their class and spec, gear themselves up to the level that is feasible
        outside raids and, most importantly, to earn the spot in our raids they wish to participate in.
        Concerning the required gear, this means the best gear you can get before looting the latest
        raiding bosses; if one or two items are missing, it could be negotiable with the Raid Leaders,
        but it is always on their discretion, depending on what is best for the guild’s progress. There
        are several threads on our forums regarding sites one must visit in order to be sure his or her
        knowledge of his class, spec, glyphs, rotation, buffs in raids, enchants, gems, gears and boss
        tactics is excellent. Please, if you have problem finding such information on the internet, ask
        one of our Class Leaders and Officers and they will gladly offer you advice on where to start
        studying over the internet. Don’t expect from someone else to tell you what each new patch and
        expansion change about your class; if you dedicate 30 minutes every few weeks on reading up on
        class changes and new content, you will be adequately prepared for everything.</p>

    <p>Please keep in mind a very important fact of this guild: most of our guild members are grown-up
        people with jobs and families. That means that we cannot raid every day of the week; we all have
        social lives we cherish. In that respect, we are not a hardcore raiding guild. Nevertheless, we
        expect from our raiders to know the fights, to enjoy raiding, to crave for progress and, most
        importantly, to achieve progress.</p>

    <p>1. Apart from good knowledge of their class, our raiders must have certain addons installed: Omen
        Threat Meter, Deadly Boss Mods or BigWigs and some class-specific addons, like Decursive or
        something equivalent. It is also imperative that everyone has Mumble installed, together with
        headphones and a microphone. We currently have one Mumble server, the information for which can
        be found on our forums.</p>

    <p>Especially during raid times, it is requested that talking over Mumble is kept to a minimum at
        boss fights, so that our raid leaders can be easily heard by every raid member. In general,
        during fights, raiders are not supposed to speak in Mumble, unless they are designated an attack
        or event to call out to the raid.</p>

    <p>2. Please make your best to attend as often as possible. It is expected that our raiders log in
        about 30 minutes before the scheduled time of a raid, if possible of course, in order to make
        the final preparations before a given raid. If you can only make it online at the time a raid
        starts, you must inform the raid leader in advance of this, so that he is aware of it and forms
        the rest of the group as normal. If you show up for a raid on time but can only stay on-line for
        a limited amount of time, please say so ahead of time to the raid leaders. If you start raiding
        with the guild and, suddenly, in the middle of the raid, you declare that you have to go, your
        chances for being reinvited are severely reduced.</p>

    <p>Not showing up on time for a raid you have accepted is considered a serious offence; such members
        will start gathering up penalty points. Each point will result in the member concerned not being
        given priority to raid spots for a week, starting from the next day after the raid concerned.
        Each additional point will prolong that period for one more week. Both the points gathered so
        far and the date this unprivileged status ends will be stated on the Officer note of the member
        concerned. Such notes will have the following form: “n P.-d.m.y” (where “d”, “m” and “y” stand
        for day, month and year respectively, indicating the date the “unprivileged” period ends,
        whereas “n” before “P.” is a number between 1 and 3 indicating the number of penalty points a
        member has). If a member with three points continues to not showing up to raids he or she has
        accepted, no further points are added, but such behaviour may well result in getting kicked out
        of the guild. The points gathered are only erased when the “unprivileged” period ends.</p>

    <p>In general, it is absolutely mandatory that you report to a raid leader as soon as possible any
        reason why you cannot make it to a raid, so that the raid organiser can make an arrangement or
        replacement in order to accommodate your lateness or even absence.</p>

    <p>3. When people show up for a raid, they must be fully prepared. They must have with them all the
        consumables and reagents needed, they must have read the tactics (including for trash) and
        watched the videos for the bosses we are about to meet and they must be properly geared and
        specced (no PvP items please). Proper gear includes proper enchants and gems.</p>

    <p>Specifically regarding skill, gear and experience, we always seek to employ a policy of schooling
        raiders and gearing them (but not boosting), so far as this does not become a burden on the
        guild’s progress and on our guild members’ enjoyment of their WoW experience. Nevertheless, we
        have high standards in our raids and, if you do not put in the effort to learn your class, spec,
        rotation and gear buffing, we will not invest time in you. WoW is a gear-based game; quite
        simply, if you haven’t got the stats for the raid in question, you will be unlikely to come,
        unless everyone else seriously overgears it and can carry you (which will not be in our
        progression raids).</p>

    <p>4. In case of some people having been left out of a certain raid due to lack of spots, it will be
        the raid leaders’ duty to make their best, so that those left behind join a raid the next time.
        In any case, there will be a rotation of guild members filling up spots, so that everyone has a
        chance to raid, if he or she so wishes and if the requirements for such a raid are met. For
        those left behind on a given raid, it is our raid leaders’ obligation to whisper to them, at the
        time the raid is formed, that they are not going to come and explain to them the reasons for
        that. Please note that for our progress teams this rule does not apply: a solid raiding progress
        team will have a fixed roster, as far as possible.</p>

    <p>Every Sunday, our raid leaders will send invitations for all raids for the following raid period,
        which starts at 9:00 am on Wednesday and ends at 8:59 am on next week’s Wednesday. In addition,
        for each raid organised through the calendar, our raid leaders will also make an announcement
        there, informing every guild member of the raids that are going to happen on that particular
        day, so that everybody knows the raiding activity of our guild, even if they are not invited to
        particular raids.</p>

    <p>As a result, every single member will be able to tell what raids are going to happen and schedule
        his or her playing time accordingly. Most importantly, however, he or she will be able to know
        ahead which raids he or she is allowed to visit with PuGs. Please note that, if you are invited
        to a raid, you are expected to keep your saves for the guild, unless you know well in advance
        that you will definitely not be able to attend on that given date and notified the raid leaders
        in advance. If, at the time a raid is formed, you are online and it is found out that you are
        saved to a raid you have been invited to and not denied, a penalty point will be added on your
        Officer note, the consequences of which will be exactly the same as those mentioned in part 2
        above.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that all raids have some minimum requirements concerning performance and gear. Since
        it is very easy to collect the proper gear for the normal versions of even the most demanding
        raids (except at the beginning of each expansion), it is expected from our raiders to spend
        their non-raiding time to become fully prepared for our progress raids. It is important to note
        that we do not boost our members; each raider participating in a raid is expected to contribute
        to it, rather than be carried along. We will not enforce this rule to less demanding raids,
        mainly because, as a guild, we want to help members with less free time to experience as much
        content of the game as possible; nevertheless, if a member has the free time necessary, he or
        she should spend it in order to gear up his or her character. We strongly believe that, when
        boosted, you do not learn and, as such, it is discouraged at all times.</p>

    <p>5. Attitude during a raid is something we very seriously take into account. Quite simply, if you
        have a poor attitude, you will not endear yourself to get raid spots, even less so if you cause
        offence to people. Disrupting the guild or annoying other members will get you kicked not just
        from the raid team, but from the guild too. Absolutely no one is allowed to comment on other
        people’s performance, except for the raid leaders. If you feel that something should be
        mentioned, please do so at an appropriate time (i.e. not during a boss fight) by whispering to a
        raid leader. Bragging about DPS and showing off Recount numbers is something frowned upon.</p>

    <p>6. During boss fights, your full attention and focus will be required. If you repeatedly fail to
        follow the orders issued by the raid leaders (or tanks, in the absence of raid leaders) during a
        boss fight, you simply lower your chances to be reinvited to a raid. Going AFK is also something
        that should be avoided, unless it is an emergency; please wait until our raid leaders have
        called for a short break. Simply saying in raid chat or Ventrilo that you need to go AFK for a
        while is not enough; we try to minimise the time of our raids, so such breaks are kept to a bare
        minimum.</p>

    <p>7. We do not use a DKP system for loot distribution. If the need arises, especially in 25-man
        raids, we prefer a Loot Council system, but only as a last resort, which means only if two or
        more people are interested in the same item and are not happy with a roll (or if the raid
        leaders are not happy with a roll). In that event, the Master Looter, together with two random
        leaders, on the condition that none of them are interested in that item (if they are, they are
        replaced), goes to a special Ventrilo channel and the three of them decide on whom that
        particular item goes to. Guild and raid enhancement, particularly regarding tanks and healers,
        is one of the most important factors taken into consideration, as well as raid attendance and
        punctuality. Another factor is how much of an upgrade for the raider interested the piece is,
        though this is not as important as the previous factor; to that end, those concerned should link
        their current piece of equipment, so that everyone sees the importance of their upgrade. General
        behaviour and participation within our guild is another factor that may be taken into
        consideration, as well as how recently the raider interested got his or her last upgrade.</p>

    <p>Please refrain from using newly acquired items right away; absolutely no item should be used
        without the proper enchants and gems.</p>

    <h2 id="6">6. Raid Schedules and Invitations</h2>

    <p>Each raid instance has certain requirements that need to be met in order to successfully clear
        it. It is unnecessary to list them here; a simple browsing over the internet will give the
        pertinent information.</p>

    <p>As mentioned in the “Guild Positions” part of our Guild Policies, if a guild member believes that
        he or she is suitable for a raid of a certain difficulty, it is his or her duty to contact the
        appropriate class leader (or, in the absence of one, a raid leader or another officer) in order
        to be tested and determined for which raids he or she is eligible.</p>

    <p>It is stressed once more that, if you are invited to a raid, you are supposed to keep your save
        until that day, unless you know in advance that you are not going to make it, in which case you
        must decline the invitation and notify the raid leaders of it, if possible. Even if you do not
        get a spot in that raid on that day, you will be on the standby team while the raid is
        happening, in case a spot is made unexpectedly available. Even though there is no penalty for
        not doing so, staying on-line in the standby team definitely shows an eagerness to raid that
        should and will be awarded with spots in future raids. As mentioned elsewhere, the raid leaders
        must whisper every single guild member who has accepted a raid invitation and shown up on time
        and explain to him or her, at the time the raid is formed, the reasons for not getting a spot on
        that raid. Other than that, it is actually forbidden to complain in public channels about being
        left behind; if one wants to do that, he or she can always talk about it with the raid leaders,
        the officers or the guild master at an opportune time, which can never be during a raid.</p>

    <p>Our raiding schedule may change every week, but we will try to keep the following one every
        time:</p>

    <p>Wednesday, 20:30 - 23:00: latest patch’s raids</p>

    <p>Thursday - no scheduled raids</p>

    <p>Friday, 20:30 - midnight: latest patch’s raids</p>

    <p>Saturday - no scheduled raids</p>

    <p>Sunday - no scheduled raids</p>

    <p>Monday, 20:30 - 23:00: latest patch’s raids</p>

    <p>Tuesday - no scheduled raids.</p>

    <p>Please note that this schedule may change as our raid leaders see fit, in which case this bit of
        our guild policies will be updated.</p>

    <p>There may be times when our raid leaders, on their own initiative or at the request of a guild
        member, decide that we visit a raid for certain achievements in it. When this happens, the
        invitations to it may not be the usual ones.</p>

    <p>If you want to request a particular raid (especially a raid that was introduced in the game
        before the latest expansion) or particular achievements for a raid, please say so in the
        “Raiders’ retreat” part of our forums (the parent subforum), so that our raid leaders can
        arrange for it on the next raiding week, if possible.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that the raiding schedules shown above are the ones most suited to our current
        members’ needs. If you cannot make it on one or more days, rather than persistently asking for
        our raiding schedules to be changed, it would suit you better to find another guild with more
        convenient raiding times for you. Simply put, when you cannot make it on our raiding times, you
        gain no progress in our guild, you contribute nothing to our guild and, from your point of view,
        you gain no progress yourself.</p>

    <h2 id="7">7. Recruitment</h2>

    <p>As mentioned in the “Guild Ranks” section of our Guild Policies, only Veterans, Leaders, Officers
        and the GM can recruit. You are free to suggest people for recruitment for our casual, RP or
        leveling sections; if, however, you know of someone who wishes to join us for our raids or rated
        battlegrounds, you are kindly requested to redirect him or her to our site and our recruitment
        form found therein.</p>

    <p>New members wishing to raid with us (for either PvP or PvE content) are kindly requested to fill
        in the recruitment form found in our Recruitment section of our site. Our officers, in
        collaboration to the recruitment officers, will then decide on your admittance a trial raid or
        rated battleground in order to ascertain your skills and experience. After a satisfactory
        performance on that trial, you will be offered an invitation to the guild and to its PvE or PvP
        section (or both). Being admitted to the guild does not entitle you to a spot on the very first
        raid or rated battleground since you logged; please understand that current members may have
        priority over you and that you will also need to be tested, especially in terms of attendance
        and character. In addition, as explained elsewhere in our Guild Policies, all newcomers in our
        guild remain in the Initiative rank for 2 weeks, after which they are accorded higher ranks with
        more privileges.</p>

    <p>We have specific rules regarding alts. First of all, as mentioned elsewhere, we may accept low
        level characters, but as a general rule, we only allow newcomers with the highest possible
        character level. After each expansion, with the exception of those members with the Veteran rank
        or higher, guild members are demoted back to the Member rank until they reach the highest
        possible character level again and get promoted to the pertaining ranks, where appropriate.
        Since the one-month inactivity rule applies to all guild members, those characters are expected
        to reach that level as fast as possible. In order to bring an alt to the guild, a member must
        have his main in it, who must be of the highest character level possible. Secondly, a guild
        member can bring as many alts as he wishes in the guild, as long as they are of the highest
        character level possible. Furthermore, such a member can bring one alt only of lower level. If
        he wants to bring more, he can either remove his low level alt from the guild, in order to make
        space for another one, or simply wait for that alt to reach the highest level, in which case
        another low level alt can join.</p>

    <p>One final note: absolutely no new raider will be admitted to our raids or rated battlegrounds,
        unless he has completed his registration on our web site. A proper e-mail must be given during
        registration, which will be completed only after you confirm your registration in the e-mail
        sent to you.</p>
