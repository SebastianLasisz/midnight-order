                        <h2>Social Media Platforms</h2>

                            privacy policies held with each social media platform respectively. </p>

                        <p>Users are advised to use social media platforms wisely and communicate / engage upon them
                            with due care and caution in regard to their own privacy and personal details. This website
                            nor it's owners will ever ask for personal or sensitive information through social media

                        <p>This website may use social sharing buttons which help share web content directly from web

                        <hr>
                        <h2>Shortened Links in Social Media</h2>

                        <p>This website and it's owners through their social media platform accounts may share web links
                            to relevant web pages. By default some social media platforms shorten lengthy url's [web
                            addresses] (this is an example: http://bit.ly/zyVUBo). </p>

                        <p>Users are advised to take caution and good judgement before clicking any shortened url's
                            published on social media platforms by this website and it's owners. Despite the best
                            efforts to ensure only genuine url's are published many social media platforms are prone to
                            spam and hacking and therefore this website and it's owners cannot be held liable for any
                            damages or implications caused by visiting any shortened links.</p>
