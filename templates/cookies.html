    <h2>About cookies</h2>

    <p>Cookies are information packets sent by web servers to web browsers, and stored by the web
        browsers.</p>

    <p>The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from
        the server. This enables a web server to identify and track web browsers.</p>

    <p>There are two main kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies
        are deleted from your computer when you close your browser, whereas persistent cookies
        remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach their expiry date.

        Contractology and available at www.freenetlaw.com. Contractology supply a range of
        commercial contracts and other legal documents, such as template sales terms and
